# Linked-list
A linked list is like a chain of boxes. Each box (node) holds some data and a pointer to the next box. The first box is called the head, and the last one points to nothing. It’s flexible—you can easily add or remove boxes—but you have to go through them one by one to find something.This is all about linked list.
